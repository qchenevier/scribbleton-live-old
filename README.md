# Scribbletune playground with Vue

A [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) playground to experiment sound synthesis with [Tone.js (v14.7.7)](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/14.7.7/) & melody making with [scribbletune](https://scribbletune.com/)

## Installation & Usage

- `git clone` the repo
- `npm install` to install the project dependencies
- `npm run serve` to start the app development server
- go to http://localhost:8080 to see the app
- ⚠️ there is no `npm run build` script for now

#### Template source

I found a minimalistic boilerplate to build a webpack + vue application (only html/JS/css, no scss, no pug) [here on freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-vue-js-app-using-single-file-components-without-the-cli-7e73e5b8244f/)
